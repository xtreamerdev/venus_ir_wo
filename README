Realtek Venus IR Write-Only device driver


Description:

The aim of this driver is to add write capability to the existing Venus IR
driver used on RTD 1073/1283 Linux based platforms.

Once installed, the module will create a /dev/venus_irrp_wo driver, to which
you can write (binary) sequences of IR codes.
A 'fakekey' sysfs is also created in /sys/devices/platform/VenusIR_W/fakekey,
so that you can use something like:
   echo 'fa05ff00' > /sys/devices/platform/VenusIR_W/fakekey
to send an IR key to the IR driver  


Compilation:

You must have the sources for an RTD 1073/1283 Linux kernel available, as well
as a MIPS compilation toolchain. You can find a fedora VMWare image with such
a toolchain, as well as an RTD1283 kernel source (for Xtreamer devices) at:
   http://code.google.com/p/xtreamerdev/downloads/list 

Edit KERNELDIR in the Makefile to point to your kernel source and run 'make'


Installation:

Copy venus_ir_wo.ko to your Realtek system, and run:
   insmod venus_ir_wo.ko
(For debug, you can add a 'debug=1' parameter to the line above)
This will create /dev/venus_irrp_wo and /sys/devices/platform/VenusIR_W/fakekey
which you can then use to send IR keys to running applications

Note:

Depending on the device and applications, you may have to send the same key 
twice for it to be recognized.
